I'll have to re-read my notes carefully.$(br2)I can start a _Hex by pressing $(k:use) with a $(item)Staff/$ in my hand-- this will cause a hexagonal grid of dots to appear in front of me. Then I can click and drag from dot to dot to draw patterns in the _media of the grid; finishing a pattern will run its corresponding action (more on that later).",

I can also press Escape if I want to quit early, if I don't mind the chance of a small mishap.

In short:$(li)$(italic)Patterns/$ will execute...$(li)$(italic)Actions/$, which manipulate...$(li)$(italic)The Stack/$, which is a list of...$(li)$(italic)Iotas/$, which are simply units of information.",
  "hexcasting.page.101.3": "First, $(thing)patterns/$. These are essential-- they're what I use to manipulate the _media around me. Certain patterns, when drawn, will cause $(thing)actions/$ to happen. Actions are what actually $(italic)do/$ the magic; all patterns influence _media in particular ways, and when those influences end up doing something useful, we call it an action.$(br2)_Media can be fickle: if I draw an invalid pattern, I'll get some garbage result somewhere on my stack (read on...)",
  "hexcasting.page.101.4.header": "An Example",
  "hexcasting.page.101.4": "It's interesting to note that the $(italic)rotation/$ of a pattern doesn't seem to matter at all. These two patterns both perform an action called $(l:patterns/basics#hexcasting:get_caster)$(action)Mind's Reflection/$, for example.",

(These actions are called \"spells.\")$(p)When I start casting a _Hex, it creates an empty stack. Actions manipulate the top of that stack.",
  "hexcasting.page.101.6": "For example, $(l:patterns/basics#hexcasting:get_caster)$(action)Mind's Reflection/$ will create an iota representing $(italic)me/$, the caster, and add it to the top of the stack. $(l:patterns/basics#hexcasting:get_entity_pos)$(action)Compass Purification/$ will take the iota at the top the stack, if it represents an entity, and transform it into an iota representing that entity's location.$(br2)So, drawing those patterns in that order would result in an iota on the stack representing my position.",

I suspect that whole blocks or crystals are too solid to be easily unraveled into _media.",
  "hexcasting.page.101.11": "It's also worth noting that each action will consume the _media it needs immediately, rather than all at once when the Hex finishes. Also, an action will always consume entire items-- an action that only requires one $(item)Amethyst Dust/$'s worth of _media will consume an entire $(item)Charged Amethyst Crystal/$, if that's all that's present in my inventory.$(br2)Thus, it might be a good idea to bring dust for spellcasting too-- waste not, want not...",
