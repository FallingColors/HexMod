  "hexcasting.page.1014header": "An Example",
  "hexcasting.page.1014": "It's interesting to note that the $(italic)rotation/$ of a pattern doesn't seem to matter at all. These two patterns both perform the $(l:patterns/basics#hexcasting:get_caster)$(action)Mind's Reflection/$, for example.",

  "hexcasting.page.1017": "$(thing)Iotas/$ can represent things like myself or my position, but there are several other types I can manipulate with $(thing)Actions$(0).

  "hexcasting.page.1019": "Of course, there's no such thing as a free lunch. All spells, and certain other actions, require _media as payment.$(br2)The best I can figure, a _Hex is a little bit like a plan of action presented to Nature-- in this analogy, the _media is used to provide the arguments to back it up, so Nature will accept your plan and carry it out.",
  "hexcasting.page.10110": "That aside, it doesn't seem like anyone has done much research on exactly how $(italic)much/$ any particular piece of amethyst is valued. The best I can tell, an $(item)Amethyst Shard/$ is worth about five pieces of $(item)Amethyst Dust/$, and a $(item)Charged Amethyst Crystal/$ is worth about ten.$(br2)Strangely enough, it seems like no other form of amethyst is suitable to be used in the casting of a _Hex. I suspect that whole blocks or crystals are too solid to be easily unraveled into _media.",
  "hexcasting.page.10111": "It's also worth noting that each action will consume the _media it needs immediately, rather than all at once when the Hex finishes. Also, an action will always consume entire items-- an action that only requires one $(item)Amethyst Dust/$'s worth of _media will consume an entire $(item)Charged Amethyst Crystal/$, if that's all that's present in my inventory.$(br2)Thus, it might be a good idea to bring dust for spellcasting too-- waste not, want not...",
  "hexcasting.page.10112": "I should also be careful to make sure I actually have enough Amethyst in my inventory-- some old texts say that Nature is happy to use one's own mind as payment instead.

I can't imagine burning pieces of my mind for power is $(italic)healthy/$.",
  "hexcasting.page.10113": "Maybe something's changed, though. In my experiments, I've never managed to do it; if I run out of _media, the spell will simply fail to cast, as if some barrier is blocking it from harming me. $(br2)It would be interesting to get to the bottom of the mystery, but for now I suppose it'll keep me safe.",
  "hexcasting.page.10114": "I have also found an amusing tidbit on why so many practitioners of magic in general seem to go mad, which I may like as some light and flavorful reading not canonical to my world.$(br2)$(italic)Content Warning: some body horror and suggestive elements./$",

  "hexcasting.page.influences2": "In addition, I've discovered a curious triplet of influences I've named Consideration, Introspection, and Retrospection.

  "hexcasting.page.influences3": "Finally, there seems to be an infinite family of influences that just seem to be a tangled mess of _media. I've named them $(action)Garbage/$, as they are completely useless. They seem to appear in my stack at random, like pests, when I drawn an invalid pattern.
