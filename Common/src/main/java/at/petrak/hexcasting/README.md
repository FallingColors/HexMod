Hello, intrepid Github reader!

The "flavor text" words for things in this mod and the internal names are different. (Sorry.)

- A "Hex" is a `Cast`, cast through a [`CastingHarness`](api/casting/eval/vm/CastingVM.kt)
- A "Pattern" is a [`HexPattern`](api/casting/math/HexPattern.kt)
- An "Action" is an [`Operator`](api/casting/castables/Action.kt)
- An action that pushes a spell is a [`Spell`](api/casting/castables/SpellAction.kt)
