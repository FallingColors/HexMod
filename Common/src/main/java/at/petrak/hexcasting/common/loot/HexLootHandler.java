// We need to inject dungeon loot (scrolls and lore), make amethyst drop fewer shards, and the extra dust stuff.
// On forge:
// - Scrolls, lore, and cyphers are done with a loot mod
// - Amethyst drop fiddling is done with another loot mod; the shard delta is in the loot mod data and the rest of
//   the stuff is loaded from TABLE_INJECT_AMETHYST_CLUSTER
// On fabric:
// - Scrolls, lore, and cyphers are done with a lootLoad listener and the amounts are loaded from config
// - Amethyst shard reduction is done with a loot function mixed in to always be on amethyst clusters, god, cause I
//   don't think it's facile to use the loot pool api to try to figure out which pool is for the amethyst and reduce it
// - Amethyst dust and crystals are done by adding the loot table Forge uses in directly via listener
