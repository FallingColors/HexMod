## The Branches

We are currently developing Hexcasting v0.11.x for 1.20.1, on the `main` branch.

The 0.10.x versions, for 1.19, are in long-term support. We probably won't be adding any new features, but we will try
to fix bugs. Those are on the `1.19` branch.

The 0.9.x versions, for 1.18.2, are in long-term support. We probably won't be adding any new features, but we will try
to fix bugs. Those are on the `1.18` branch.

The `gh-pages` branch is for the online Hex book.

Other branches are old detritus from potential features.

## For Developers

We publish artifacts on Maven at [https://maven.blamejared.com/at/petra-k/hexcasting/]. The modern coordinates are at:

> `hexcasting-[PLATFORM]-[MC VERSION]/[MOD VERSION]`

There are some other folders in the `hexcasting` folder from old CI configurations; ignore those, they're stale.

Please only use things in the `at.petrak.hexcasting.api` package. (We do try to keep the API fairly stable, but we don't
do a very good job.) If you find you need something not in there yell at me on Discord.
